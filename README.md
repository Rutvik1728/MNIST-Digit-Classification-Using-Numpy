## Multi Layer MNIST Digit Classifier

A NeuralNet class was implemented for the purpose of creating a multi-layer neuron model

1. The neural network is based on Feed Forward Neural Network architecture
2. The layers and the number of neurons in the layers is provided as an input to the network
3. The activation functions that can be used for hidden layers are relu and softmax
4. The activation function used for the output layer is softmax for classification purpose
